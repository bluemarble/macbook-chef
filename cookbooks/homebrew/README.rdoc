= DEPRECATION NOTICE

Sadly I no longer use chef in my day-to-day work (the ops team at the last company
I worked for chose Puppet and life is too short to keep several configuration
management syntaxes/APIs in my head!) so this cookbook has fallen into disrepair.

It is now being maintained by the Opscode team. See their fork here:
